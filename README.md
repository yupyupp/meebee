OH I/O Hackathon 2015 Project

An encrypted protocol-independent data storage back-end.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a storage service that encrypts and stores data in such a way that it is not able to be accessed by anyone other than the account holder. 

## TODO
Finish this README :P
